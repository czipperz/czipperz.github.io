        <p class="date">9/23/2015</p>
        <p>
          As we saw in the last post, <i>Java to C++ -
            Destructors</i>, giving a <code>string</code> to
          the <code>getline</code> function will modify it to be the
          current line buffered by the stream.  This is really cool,
          but it is dangerous because the side effects, or places
          where variables change, can be obscured.
        </p>
        <p>
          C++ helps to ease this pain by allowing you to declare a
          variable as <code>const</code>.  This allows you to only
          use functions on it that don't modify the state of the
          object, or read public variables from the object.  Passing
          a variable by constant reference is a really cool feature
          that allows a function to look at the contents but not
          modify them.
        </p>
        <p>
          <code>const</code> is very similar to
          the <code>final</code> keyword, but <i>much more
            powerful</i>.  Every type in Java is a pointer, meaning
          that it is really just a value that tells you where to
          look for the actual value.  The final keyword just tells
          the compiler that you can't change the address that the
          pointer points to, but the const keyword does that too!
        </p>
        <p>
          An ampersand after a type but before the name of a
          variable tells the compiler that it is a reference.  Let's
          look at an example.
        </p>
        <pre class="prettyprint">
#include &lt;assert.h&gt;
#include &lt;string&gt;

int main() {
    std::string str = "Hello World!";
    const std::string  immutable_copy      = str;
    const std::string& immutable_reference = str;

    str = "Different string";

    // compile errors, can't change state of const object:
    // immutable_reference = "";
    // immutable_copy = "";

    assert(immutable_copy == "Hello World!");
    assert(immutable_reference == "Different string");

// str and immutable_copy are deleted at this closing brace.
// immutable_reference doesn't need to be deleted as it isn't a value type.
}</pre>
        <p>
          As you can see, the reference maintains shares the same
          memory as the value, <code>str</code>.  References are
          just like final objects in Java.  The key difference
          between references and pointers are that references cannot
          be <code>null</code> as they have to point to a memory
          location when they are declared.  This gives them
          incredible power as parameters because null checks are
          redundant.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can see that the <code>.equals()</code> method isn't
          used to compare objects because you can just overload
          the <code>==</code> operator.  Don't worry, you can still
          compare memory addresses, but we'll get to that later.
          Operator overloading is a very powerful feature of C++
          that isn't in Java.  It allows you to treat classes as
          builtin types, which I'll post later about.
        </p>
        <p>
          The main reason references are so popular is that they can
          make a huge improvement over value types for arguements to
          a method.  A value type is one that is not a pointer or
          reference.  They aren't very popular as they have to
          be <i>cloned when used as an argument</i>.  Let's look at
          an example of const references used as function inputs.
          These are a popular subgenre because they ensure that
          there won't be a change to the object passed in while
          maintaining high performance.
        </p>
        <pre class="prettyprint">
#include &lt;string&gt;

std::string concat(std::string a, std::string b) {
    return a + b;
}</pre>
        <p>
          The problem with this code is that the strings are passed
          by value but then not modified, making that operation
          unnecessary and a waste of resources.  To get a nice
          performance boost, all we have to change is the
          declaration of the function!
        </p>
        <pre class="prettyprint">
std::string concat(const std::string& a, const std::string& b) {
    return a + b;
}</pre>
        <p>
          You might think that returning a reference to the string
          created by the <code>+</code> operator would be a good
          idea, but that would enact <i>undefined behavior</i>.
          This is because the result of the <code>+</code> operator
          is deleted at the closing brace, but with a value type the
          compiler will optimize the unnecessary copy and immediate
          deletion and just return the value.  A general rule of
          thumb is to never return a reference if it points to a
          variable declared during the scope of the function.
