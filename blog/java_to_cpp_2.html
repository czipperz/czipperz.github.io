        <p class="description">9/22/2015</p>
        <p>
          C++ is not a managed language.  This basically means that
          there is no garbage collector.  The good thing about this is
          that there is no startup time or garbage collector overhead.
          The design goal of C++ was to be:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Extremely general/flexible</li>
          <li>Zero-overhead abstractions</li>
          <li>Well-specified interfaces</li>
        </ul>
        <span style="font-size:12px">&mdash; Bjarne Stroustrup,
          inventor of C++, <i>"Make Simple Tasks Simple!"</i> CppCon 2014</span>

        <p>
          This means that they make speedups that may not seem right
          until you understand the reasoning behind it.  But this post
          is about destructors, arguably the best feature of C++ that
          doesn't exist in Java.  Destructors force the destruction of
          resources when a block of code ends.  Let's look at an
          example:
        </p>
        <pre class="prettyprint linenums">
#include &lt;fstream&gt;
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;string&gt;

int main() {
    using namespace std;

    ifstream file_stream("file");
    string first_line;
    getline(file_stream, first_line);

    cout &lt;&lt; "First line of file is: " &lt;&lt; first_line &lt;&lt; endl;
}</pre>
        <p>
          The first two lines tell the compiler to basically import
          the file stream and input output stream headers (fstream and
          iostream respectively).  The &lt;&gt; around the name tells
          it that it is a system header and that you didn't make it.
        </p>
        <p>
          The line <code>using namespace std;</code> tells the
          compiler to look up any members it doesn't see itself in the
          namespace <code>std</code>.  For example, this shortens the
          usage of <code>std::cout</code> to <code>cout</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The <code>ifstream</code> allow you to read input from a
          file, assuming that it exists.  We will for the sake of the
          example.  In Java you would have to wrap this operation in a
          try catch block, then close the resource at the end.  If an
          exception occurs that you don't catch, the file will never
          be closed!  In C++ the destructor for an object will always
          be called when the resource falls out of scope: in this case
          at the end of the main function.  This makes sure that
          resources are properly disposed <i>no matter what</i>,
          removing the resource cleanup strain from the user, the
          point of a garbage collector in the first place!
        </p>
        <p>
          The line <code>string first_line;</code> allocates a
          string that will be deleted when the main function ends.
          Writing <code>String firstLine;</code> in Java will
          allocate a <i>pointer</i> to a String but won't actually
          allocate it.  You can do the exact same thing, but it is
          bad form.  It is very similar to a <code>String</code> in
          Java except that it is modifiable.  You may think that
          immutable Strings in Java are a great feature and they
          are, but C++ allows you a variable as immutable by adding
          the keyword <code>const</code> rather than designing two
          different classes to do the same thing.  This has a great
          speed improvement as you don't have central cache of
          immutable strings and don't need multiple allocations for
          one string object.
        </p>
        <p>
          The last line of real code is a function call
          of <code>getline</code>.  This reads a line out of a stream
          and puts it into the second variable given, a string
          reference.  A reference simply means that that other method
          can change the contents of it, just like a normal Object in
          Java.
        </p>
        <p>
          The final line just prints out the first line of the file
          that you acquired in the <code>getline()</code> statement.
        </p>
        <p>
          All the destructors are actually called at the very last
          line, the <code>}</code>.  First the <code>string
            first_line</code> will be deleted, then
          the <code>ifstream</code>.  This ensures that the
          resources acquired are deleted no matter what happens
          after they are aquired: a process called RAII - Resource
          Acquisition Is Initialization.
