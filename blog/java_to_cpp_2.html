            C++ is not a managed language.  This basically means that
            there is no garbage collector.  The good thing about this is
            that there is no startup time or garbage collector overhead.
            The design goal of C++ was to be:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Extremely general/flexible</li>
            <li>Zero-overhead abstractions</li>
            <li>Well-specified interfaces</li>
          </ul>

            This means that they make speedups that may not seem right
            until you understand the reasoning behind it.  But this post
            is about destructors, arguably the best feature of C++ that
            doesn't exist in Java.  Destructors force the destruction of
            resources when a block of code ends.  Let's look at an
            example:
          </p>
          <pre class="prettyprint">
            #include &lt;fstream&gt;
            #include &lt;iostream&gt;
            #include &lt;string&gt;

            int main() {
                using namespace std;

                ifstream file_stream("file");
                string first_line;
                getline(file_stream, first_line);

                cout << "First line of file is: " << first_line << endl;
            }
          </pre>
          <p>
            The first two lines tell the compiler to basically import
            the file stream and input output stream headers (fstream and
            iostream respectively).  The &lt;&gt; around the name tells
            it that it is a system header and that you didn't make it.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            The line <code>using namespace std;</code> tells the
            compiler to look up any members it doesn't see itself in the
            namespace <code>std</code>.  For example, this shortens the
            usage of <code>std::cout</code> to <code>cout</code>.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            The <code>ifstream</code> allow you to read input from a
            file, assuming that it exists.  We will for the sake of the
            example.  In Java you would have to wrap this operation in a
            try catch block, then close the resource at the end.  If an
            exception occurs that you don't catch, the file will never
            be closed!  In C++ the destructor for an object will always
            be called when the resource falls out of scope: in this case
            at the end of the main function.  This makes sure that
            resources are properly disposed <i>no matter what</i>,
            removing the resource cleanup strain from the user, the
            point of a garbage collector in the first place!
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            The line <code>string first_line;</code> allocates a
            string that will be deleted when the main function ends.
            Writing <code>String firstLine;</code> in Java will
            allocate a <i>pointer</i> to a String but won't actually
            allocate it.  You can do the exact same thing, but it is
            bad form.  It is very similar to a <code>String</code> in
            Java except that it is modifiable.  You may think that
            immutable Strings in Java are a great feature and they
            are, but C++ allows you a variable as immutable by adding
            the keyword <code>const</code> rather than designing two
            different classes to do the same thing.  This has a great
            speed improvement as you don't have central cache of
            immutable strings and don't need multiple allocations for
            one string object.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            The last line of real code is a function call
            of <code>getline</code>.  This reads a line out of a stream
            and puts it into the second variable given, a string
            reference.  A reference simply means that that other method
            can change the contents of it, just like a normal Object in
            Java.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            The final line just prints out the first line of the file
            that you acquired in the <code>getline()</code> statement.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            All the destructors are actually called at the very last
            line, the <code>}</code>.  First the <code>string
              first_line</code> will be deleted, then
            the <code>ifstream</code>.  This ensures that the
            resources acquired are deleted no matter what happens
            after they are aquired: a process called RAII - Resource
            Acquisition Is Initialization.
