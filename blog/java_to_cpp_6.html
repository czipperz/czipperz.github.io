            As we saw earlier, the main goals of C++ are as follows:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Extremely general/flexible</li>
            <li>Zero-overhead abstractions</li>
            <li>Well-specified interfaces</li>
          </ul>

            This means that when you have to make methods that accept
            general types, you have to make it fast and flexible.
            Java tries to do general types with interfaces and generic
            types.  This works well, but incurs a big runtime
            overhead.  Let's do it anyway, because you're going to see
            it somewhere eventually.  This concept of making
            a <code>interface</code> then extending it is called
            polymorphism.  Polymorphism is a very easy way to create
            abstractions but it is pretty slow.  Here is how it works
            in C++.  Next post I'll look at <code>template metaprogramming</code>
            which is like generic programming in Java on steroids.

          <pre class="prettyprint">
            class printable {
              public:
                virtual void print() = 0;
            };

            class one : public printable {
              public:
                void print() { std::cout &lt;&lt; "one" &lt;&lt; std::end; }
            };

            class two : public printable {
              public:
                void print() { std::cout &lt;&lt; "two" &lt;&lt; std::end; }
            };
          </pre>
          <p>
            Here we see that we use a new keyword,
            <code>virtual</code> and some weird <code>= 0</code>
            thing.  <code>virtual</code> tells the compiler that this
            class should be extensible and overridden print methods
            should be called instead <code>printable</code>'s own.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            This is the default behavior in Java but it isn't in C++
            for performance reasons.  If a class isn't polymorphic,
            not having any virtual methods, then it can be turned into
            a plain old data structure and all calls to its "methods"
            are just function calls that take an implicit pointer to
            the struct.  This means that using object orientation
            without inheritance is as fast as C!
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            The <code>= 0</code> is the exact same as the abstract
            keyword.  It just enforces that the <code>printable</code>
            "interface" must have an overridden <code>print</code>
            method to be able to be constructed.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            One thing you should note is that you use a colon to show
            extension, rather than a keyword.  The colon takes a list
            of classes and the way in which to extend them.  By
            default, inheritance is <code>private</code>.  This means
            that only your class knows that it is an instance of the
            other class.  Most of the time private inheritance is used
            when you want to do advanced template metaprogramming and
            public inheritance is done most everywhere else.
            Protected inheritance is the other modifier, meaning that
            only subclasses have access to the data or to the knowledge of inheritance, as there are no
            packages in C++.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Now let's look at an example of subtle problems with
            polymorphism in C++.  Java solves this by making
            everything a pointer, and the behavior of a pointer in C++
            is the same intuitive thing that it is in Java.  BTW
            putting braces in C++ enters a "sub scope".  It's like
            an <code>if(true) {}</code>.
          </p>
          <pre class="prettyprint">
            int main() {
                // Error!  Can't use a abstract class as value type!
                // printable x = sub();
                // Error!  Can't point a reference to an unnamed value!
                // printable& x = sub();
            
                one o;
                two t;
                {
                    printable& x = o;
                    x.print();
                    // output one
                }
                {
                    printable& x = t;
                    x.print();
                    // output two
                }
                {
                    printable& x = t;
                    x = o;
                    x.print();
                    // ouput two!  Remember that a reference is a pointer to one
                    // unchangable memory location.  Assigning to it will corrupt
                    // ``t`` rather than changing the memory location!
                }
                {
                    printable* x = &t;
                    x = &o;
                    x->print();
                    // output one!  Assigning to a pointer will change the pointer
                    // rather than the memory!
                }
            }
          </pre>
          <p>
            In the main method, we see that an interface / abstract
            class is best used as a pointer, which takes away the
            benefits of deterministic destruction at the end of scopes.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            The problem with polymorphism is that it forces the entire
            class to be allocated differently and that method call to
            be looked up at runtime.  Template Metaprogramming shifts
            this method lookup to compile time and makes your methods
            more general by removing interfaces and just accessing
            fields directly.  This can even make your methods
            generically work over objects and native types (int,
            float...) all in the same way!
