        <h2> Java to C++ - Hello World. </h2>
        <p>
          What is the difference between C++ and Java?  People
          experienced with both languages will give you a list of
          their favorite features not available in the other.  But it
          doesn't really matter.  What I care about are the features
          that make it so that my code makes sense.  Maybe not as
          readable <i>at first</i>, but makes sense once you
          understand it.  Lets look at some simple Java code then
          translate it to C++:
        </p>
        <pre>
          // Java
          public class Begin {
              public static void main(String[] args) {
                  System.out.println("Hello World!");
              }
          }
        </pre>
        <pre>
          // C++
          #include &lt;iostream&gt;
          int main() {
              std::cout << "Hello World!" << std::endl;
          }
        </pre>
        <p>
          This code is honestly fairly similar.  The main difference
          is that printing is done by using the
          overloaded <code>&lt;&lt;</code> operator of the global
          variable <code>std::cout</code>.  Overloading this operator
          makes the code much more understandable: just push the bits
          from the <code>"Hello World!"</code> string into the output.
          You will also notice that you don't need to have a class
          wrapped around the main statement for it to work!  C++ has
          objects, they look and work very similar to those in Java,
          but it discourages you from using them when it doesn't make
          sense to do so.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          You'll also notice the weird <code>#include</code> line.
          This informs the compiler that you want to use the functions
          provided by the iostream header provided in the standard
          library.  It literally means that the compiler will just
          substitute in the entire file at that point then actually
          compile the program.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          C++ really isn't very complicated compared to Java, it just
          does things differently and faster.
