          <h4 class="date">9/25/2015</h4>
          <p>
            Pointers are fundamentally simple.  They simply tell you
            where a value is rather than giving you the actual value.  
            However, because of how destructors work, they can be 
            dangerous to use in certain situations.
            Let's look at an example of a pointer:
          </p>
          <pre class="prettyprint">
            #include &lt;iostream&gt;
    
            int main() {
                int* int_ptr = new int(0);
                std::cout &lt;&lt; *int_ptr &lt;&lt; std::endl;

            // memory leak! int_ptr is never deleted
            // add ``delete int_ptr`` to the end, or use a value type int instead
            }
          </pre>
          <p>
            This shows the basic usage of a pointer.  In Java, ints 
            are always value types, so you have to return an int to 
            modify a variable.  In C++, everything is a value type 
            unless explicitly marked as a pointer or reference.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Pointers are different from references in that their
            semantics require a dereference before usage.  You can
            dereference a pointer into a value bye using the
            unary <code>*</code> operator.  However,
            the <code>*</code> operator is annoying as it is right
            associative.  This means that <code>*ptr.y = 10;</code>
            would be invalid as the ptr isn't dereferenced before
            usage!  To overcome this, use the <code>-&gt;</code>
            operator, which basically replaces <code>ptr-&gt;y</code>
            with <code>(*ptr).y</code>.  In C++ the <code>this</code>
            keyword is just a pointer to self, meaning that you have
            to use <code>this-&gt;field</code> to access something
            rather than <code>this.field</code>.  Note that
            Java's <code>.</code> operator is literally the exact same
            as C++'s <code>-&gt;</code> operator.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Pointers allow you to access native memory locations, so a pointer and int pair is all that an array really is!  Let's implement a simple class to represent an array:
          </p>
	  <pre class="prettyprint">
	    #include &lt;stdexcept&gt;   // std::out_of_range

	    // forces generic usage of this like Array&lt;int&gt; for 
	    // types, Array by itself is compile error!
	    template&lt;class T&gt;
	    class Array {
	        private:
		T* array_start;
		unsigned int length;

		public:
		// constructor
		Array() {
		    array_start = new T[10];
		    length = 10;
		}

		// destructor
		~Array() {
		    // not null test
		    if(array_start)
		        delete[] array_start;
                    // non pointers auto destructed
		}

		// random access - could commit suicide
	        T&amp; operator[](int index) {
		    return array_start[index];
		}

		// checked access - throws exception if out of bounds
		T&amp; at(int index) throw (std::out_of_range) {
		    if(index &lt; 0 || index &gt;= length)
		        throw std::out_of_range("Index out of range");
                    return array_start[index];
		}
            }; // all structures must end with semicolon
	  </pre>
	  <p>
            A potential problem is that any copies of
            this <code>Array</code> don't make a deep copy, they just
            copy the pointer location, resulting in a possible double
            deletion!  It also just isn't good style to have
            constructors written this way, because if any of the
            values were <code>const</code>, then it would be a syntax
            error!  Let's fix the constructors:
	  </p>
          <pre class="prettyprint">
            Array() : array_start(new T[10])
                    , length(10) { }
          </pre>
          <p>
            This now constructs the values with <code>new T[10]</code>
            and <code>10</code> rather than copying them in after they
            have been constructed.  It also separates the
            initialization from the code and makes it cleaner overall.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Now let's get into the real problem with the class, any
            copies are not true copies!  C++ has an implicitly defined
            method called a copy constructor on every object.  It is
            called to initialize a copy of an object.  For this
            reason, there is no generic clone method, just
            use <code>&lt;type&gt; copy = old;</code>!  The auto
            generated copy constructor works great for classes without
            pointers but not so well when there are pointers.  Every
            copy constructor should be accompanied by a copy
            assignment operator, as show below.
          </p>
          <pre class="prettyprint">
            #include &lt;algorithm&gt;   // std::copy

            // copy constructor
            Array(const Array& other) : array_start(new T[other.length])
                                      , length(other.length) {
                std::copy(other.array_start, other.array_start + length, array_start);
            }

            // copy assignment operator
            Array&amp; operator=(const Array& other) {
                length = other.length;

                if(array_start) delete[] array_start;
                array_start = new T[length];
                std::copy(other.array_start, other.array_start + length, array_start);
            }
          </pre>
          <p>
            As you can see, pointers and pointer arithmetic are really
            cool and powerful but they make it easy to "shoot yourself
            in the foot" if you don't know what to do with them.
          </p>
