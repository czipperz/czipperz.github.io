            What is the difference between C++ and Java?  People
            experienced with both languages will give you a list of
            their favorite features not available in the other.  But it
            doesn't really matter.  What I care about are the features
            that make it so that my code makes sense.  Maybe not as
            readable <i>at first</i>, but makes sense once you
            understand it.  Lets look at some simple Java code then
            translate it to C++:
          </p>
          <pre class="prettyprint">
// Java
public class Begin {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello World!");
    }
}
          </pre>
          <pre class="prettyprint">
// C++
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
int main() {
    std::cout << "Hello World!" << std::endl;
}
          </pre>
          <p>
            This code is honestly fairly similar.  The main difference
            is that printing is done by using the
            overloaded <code>&lt;&lt;</code> operator of the global
            variable <code>std::cout</code>.  Overloading this operator
            makes the code much more understandable: just push the bits
            from the <code>"Hello World!"</code> string into the output.
            You will also notice that you don't need to have a class
            wrapped around the main statement for it to work!  C++ has
            objects, they look and work very similar to those in Java,
            but it discourages you from using them when it doesn't make
            sense to do so.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            You'll also notice the weird <code>#include</code> line.
            This informs the compiler that you want to use the functions
            provided by the iostream header provided in the standard
            library.  It literally means that the compiler will just
            substitute in the entire file at that point then actually
            compile the program.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            C++ really isn't very complicated compared to Java, it just
            does things differently and faster.
