						A library that assists in many tasks but mainly focuses
						on graphics on JFrames (windows on the screen). It allows
						you to easily do many Java tasks without as much boiler
						plate code.

					%a(href="https://github.com/czipperz/chsWebsiteDraft") Github
					%p
						The current Corvallis High School website is pretty attrocious,
						so I decided to redesign it in my spare time. Click the button above
						to preview it. Only the Home and Departments pages have been implemented.
						More features will be coming soon.

						%a HBML
					%a(href="https://github.com/czipperz/hbml") Github
					%p
						This is an abstraction of the website design language HTML. It allows
						for you to easily create websites without as much boiler plate code.
						For example, it allows for you to declare the doctype as strict just
						by saying '!!strict' and it would complete the rest of the information
						for you.
