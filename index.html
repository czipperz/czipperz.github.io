            A library that assists in many tasks but mainly focuses
            on graphics on JFrames (windows on the screen). It allows
            you to easily do many Java tasks without as much boiler
            plate code.

            The current Corvallis High School website is pretty attrocious,
            so I decided to redesign it in my spare time. Click the button above
            to preview it. Only the Home and Departments pages have been implemented.
            More features will be coming soon.

            This is an abstraction of the website design language HTML. It allows
            for you to easily create websites without as much boiler plate code.
            For example, it allows for you to declare the doctype as strict just
            by saying '!!strict' and it would complete the rest of the information
            for you.
